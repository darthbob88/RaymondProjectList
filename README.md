## Raymond's Project List

<!--- These are examples. See https://shields.io for others or to customize this set of shields. You might want to include dependencies, project status and licence info here --->
![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/darthbob88/raymond-project-list)

A list of little projects for me to work on, to which people can add suggestions. A journal app for my sister, a media cataloger, a Discord bot to ask trivia questions. Whatever you need.

Will include at minimum a list of ideas, with detailed descriptions, and the ability to add more ideas. Hopefully will extend to ability to up/downvote projects, and to subscribe to projects to be notified when they happen. Although that might require an actual backend to send the emails. :(

Currently hosted at https://raymondprojectlist.firebaseapp.com/
